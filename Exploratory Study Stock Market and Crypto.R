SP500 is a interesting case, the stock index is used many times as a \"general picture\" for the american\n#economy, the relation between the index and crypto was always present suggesting the growing importance of \n#technological stocks within this index. We can see this growing importance of crypto and connection between this \n#financial markets with the creation of ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) for both Bitcoin and Ethereum last year listed \n#in NASDAQ and other stock index.\n\n#It is worth mentioning that further studies need to be made, the objective of this study was an exploratory\n#focus for the possible links between both traditional markets and newer less regulated markets, it does not suggest\n#a direct link or the nature of the relation between them. Further methods need to be applied considering \n#other variables into a wider model, considering inflation expectations, interest rate and other variables.\n#Also it is recommended the decomposition of variables into a more complex auto regressive model such as VAR, SVAR among others.","metadata":{"_uuid":"085de87b-6dc1-43d5-9e86-b06f53cfd30a","_cell_guid":"f876fd4d-1bbc-4842-8e9a-91e72ef09989","trusted":true,"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"rmarkdown::render(\"/kaggle/input/stock-and-crypto-closing-prices-by-week-2021-2025/Stock
