# Exploration-of-Correlation-between-Stock-Indexes-and-Cryptocurrencies
Examination of the relationship between the weekly closing prices of stock indexes (SP500, NASDAQ and Dow Jones) and the same measure for Bitcoin and Ethereum, through the span of 4 years (01-01-2021 to 01-01-2025). After compiling and transforming the data, two different correlation tests were applied, Pearson and Kendall-Tau, showing a moderation of the results in the latter one, thanks to being less sensitive to outlyers. Then the cross correlation was explored and quick Granger Causality Test. 
The stringer relation was found between the two cryptocurrencies and the stock indexes was between NASDAQ and the latter.
